**Functionality Summary**

Wi-Drive is a remote control car that a user can drive with his or her Android phone. The core functionality 
of this project is that video feed is directly steamed from another phone on the car to the user over
Wi-Fi Direct. Controls for the car are handled by the IOIO microcontroller. It is paired over Bluetooth to
phone behaving as the remote. As the user drags his or her finger across the screen of the remote phone, the
proceeds to travel in that direction.
